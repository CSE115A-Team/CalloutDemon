There are two drop-down menus on the top left of the CalloutDemon application interface and an orange button on the right. The default option of the leftmost drop-down menu is **Click**, the default option of the rightmost drop-down menu is **Ascent**, and the name of the button is **Start Game**.

 - leftmost drop-down menu
 The main function is to select the callout practice mode. 
 - The first default mode is the **click** mode, where users can practice callouts by clicking on an area on the map to guess the callout location.
 - The second mode is **vocal** mode. After the user presses T to say the location of a callout, the image in the middle of the software will change to the image of the location to help users remember the location.

- rightmost drop-down menu
The main function is to select the map for the callout practice. The default map of this menu is **Ascent**, and users can switch maps through this menu.

- Start Game button
Users can start practicing the callout by clicking this button.

There are four orange buttons at the bottom of the CalloutDemon application interface, from left to right, they are **Add Callout**, **Delete Callout**, **Save Callout**, **Create Account / Sign In**.
 - Add Callout
The main function of this button is to add a new callout. After clicking Add Callout, the user can add a new callout name to the area by dragging an area on the map.

- Delete Callout
The main function of this button is to delete the existing callout in a certain area.

- Create Account / Sign In

**Usage process:** 1. Select mode (click) 2. Select map (Ascent) 3. Click Start Game 4. Practice callout. A callout name is displayed below the map.
